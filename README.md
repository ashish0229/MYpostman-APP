PostgreSQL
Backend Setup

#Navigate to the Backend Directory:
cd backend
##Install Dependencies:
npm install

#Set Up the Database:

Open your PostgreSQL terminal (psql) or a GUI client.

Create a new database for the project.

CREATE DATABASE community_db;

Create a user and grant it privileges (replace 'your_password' with a secure password).

CREATE USER AdminAsh2911 WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE community_db TO AdminAsh2911;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO AdminAsh2911;

#Configure Environment Variables:

Create a new file named .env in the backend directory.

Copy the content from .env.example and fill in your specific credentials. It should look like this:

# API Keys
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaYourGoogleApiKey...
UNSPLASH_API_KEY=YourUnsplashApiKey...

# PostgreSQL Database Connection
DB_USER="AdminAsh2911"
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_DATABASE="community_db"
DB_PASSWORD="your_password"
DB_PORT=5432

# Application Port
PORT=3001

# Security - JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET="generate_a_long_random_secret_string"

##Run the Database Schema:
From the backend directory, run the following command to create all necessary tables. You will be prompted for your user's password.
psql -U AdminAsh2911 -d community_db -f database.sql

##Start the Backend Server:
npm run dev
The server should now be running on http://localhost:3001.

Frontend Setup

#Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
cd frontend
Install Dependencies:
npm install

##Start the Frontend Server:
npm run dev
The application will now be running on http://localhost:5173.
